            In order to better understand peopleâ€™s common similarities and
            differences, Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother Katharine Briggs
            built on the work of psychologist Carl Jung to develop a system of
            categorizing human behavior. They landed on four key dimensions that
            people could express as preferences in the way they manage their
            energy, process information, make decisions, and structure their
            day-to-day lives. Each of these preferences is represented by a
            letter, and together these preferences, denoted by four letters,
            make up your Myers Briggs personality type.
