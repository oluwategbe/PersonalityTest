Rarity chart

How Rare is the INTJ Personality?
According to psychologist David Keirsey, developer of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 1% to 4% of the population has an INTJ personality type. (The rarest personality type is INFJ.)

Extraversion vs. Introversion: How do you gain (direct and receive )energy? Extraverts like to be with others and gain energy from people and the environment. Introverts gain energy from alone-time and need periods of quiet reflection throughout the day.

Sensing vs. Intuition: How do you obtain (take in) information? Sensors gather facts from their immediate environment and rely on the things they can see, feel and hear. Intuitives look more at the overall context and think about patterns, meaning, and connections.

Thinking vs. Feeling: How do you make decisions (come to conclusions) ? Thinkers look for the logically correct solution, whereas Feelers make decisions based on their emotions, values, and the needs of others.

Judging vs. Perceiving: How do you organize your environment? Judgers prefer structure and like things to be clearly regulated, whereas Perceivers like things to be open and flexible and are reluctant to commit themselves.

How do you direct and receive energy—by focusing on the outside world, interacting with people and taking action, or by focusing on your inner world and reflecting on ideas, memories, and experiences?
How do you take in information—by focusing on what you perceive using your five senses or by seeing the big picture and looking for relationships and patterns? 
How do you decide and come to conclusions—by logically analyzing the situation or by considering what’s important to the people involved?
